Here's a project for a -non-existing- school : **_KiddyCare_** !  

A website giving the possibilities to users to check what the school has to offer, check their news through a blog and interact with the administration.  
Indeed, the targeted users (parents) can get details about the school through the different pages, request a Newsletter, book a class,leave comments for each articles posted in the school blog and leave a message.  
To access to all of those requests from users, the school manager and teachers have a back-office part. They don't have the same rights though : the school manager (admin) can access to everything whereas the teachers can only create/remove articles and related comments.   
The project is fully responsive, some elements as the menu change with the size screen.  


**_Front-end_** : 
- React , React Redux, React Router.
- API connexion with Axios
- Animation : Animation On Scroll (AOS), Animate.css
- Icon : React Icon
